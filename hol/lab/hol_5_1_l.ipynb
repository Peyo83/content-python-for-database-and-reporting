    "A common data science beginner's challenge is to examine Titantic data to look for patterns in survivability.  You are considering pursuing a career as a data scientist so you have decided to look at the Titantic data to get a cursory look at the career. The headings will lead you to what you need to do and don't forget to add a short paragraph about what the data show.\n",
